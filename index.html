      <h1>What happens when a container doesn't have a set background?</h1>
      <p>This text is here to demonstrate what happens if the container or parent container doesn't have a set background color.</p>
      <p>The issue that arises when a container doesn't have a set background, either color or image, is that on certain in-app browsers, e.g. <em>Instagram</em>, the app page will bleed through causing the app to be shown with the container text or content above it.</p>
      <p>Now for browsers that have a default device background set, that isn't really an issue, but with the arise of in-app devices having built-in browsers, this will cause a visual issue.</p>
      <p>The source for this can be found on my GitHub under the <a href="https://github.com/thinkverse/no-background-test" title="no background test repository">no-background-test repository</a>.</p>
