# No background

This repository contains the code to demonstrate what happens when a container or parent container doesn't have a set background - henceforth referenced as *container*.

### Issue

The issue that arises when a container doesn't have a set background, either color or image, is that on certain in-app browsers, e.g. **Instagram**, the app page will bleed through causing the app to be shown with the container text or content above it.
